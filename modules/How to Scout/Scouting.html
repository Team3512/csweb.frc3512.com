<h1>Scouting Intro.</h1>
<p>You have probably been tasked with a single robot to review</p>
<p>It goes without saying you must watch this robot at all times</p>
<p>It should also be noted how well it synergizes with other types of robots</p>
<p>On the scouting sheet provided there should be columns for different aspects of play</p>
<p>Give points or check in columns or check boxes appropriate</p>
<p>Give the sheet to the person tabulating the results</p>
<p>This concludes this portion of the test</p>
