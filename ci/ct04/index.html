    <p>While classical control theory involves solving differential equations
    in a frequency domain (Laplace/Fourier/Z-transform), modern control theory
    solves in state-space (time domain). In classical control, we analyze SISO
    (single input, single output) systems. In addition to these, modern control
    theory can handle MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) as well as
    non-linear and time-variant systems (which describe most practical
    problems).</p>
    <p>The state-space approach (known as modern control theory) is not
    something relatively new; it gained popularity after the 60's because it
    involved numerically (and computer) friendly matrix operations.</p>
    <p>The need to move further from simple controllers was first posed by
    aerospace researchers due to the MIMO systems that they wanted to control.
    For space applications like orbital maneuvers, attitude control or terminal
    rendezvous (Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations), state-space approaches
    might be best suited. In robotics, reasonably accurate control can be
    obtained via classical controllers applied to SISO sytem or decoupled MIMO
    sytems. However, most of the optimal control applications such as legged
    locomotion (hybrid systems), aerial acrobatics, swarm control, industrial
    robots and other highly articulated robots use state-space.</p>

    <p>Modern control theory applies tools from linear algebra to model and
    control physical systems. We recommend watching the <a href=

    to Linear Algebra</a> video series by 3Blue1Brown, which provides students
    with a geometrical understanding of linear algebra topics. Python will be
    used for performing most of the matrix operations for our purposes.</p>
