        <h1>Goals</h1>

        <p>
            The following is a list of goals the software team tries to meet each year. They inform decisions regarding our curriculum design and operating procedures.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Produce an effective product</li>
            <li>Employ industry best practices</li>
            <li>Expand our knowledge and capabilities</li>
            <li>Involve less experienced team members</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Find tasks requiring less experience</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Create an autonomous software team / encourage learning</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide access to resources for motivated students</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Curriculum_Design_Guidelines">Curriculum Design Guidelines</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Teach incoming members enough C++ to be useful</b></li>
            <p>
                Integrate modern C++ development paradigms, tools, and practices. The C++ language has improved a lot since 2003; we don't need to program in the dark ages anymore.
            </p>

            <li><b>Teach a set of skills motivated by industry practices</b></li>
            <p>
                These aren't in the extremely conservative, waterfall model sense, but in knowing how to break down and solve a problem using industry standard tools, which help students succeed in such a job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Software shall meet embedded and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing">real-time</a> requirements.
            </p>

            <li><b>Prepare students for Computer Science at university</b></li>
            <p>
                The focus should be on &quot;Design before build&quot;. That is, eveloping a specification for behavior before implementing it. Teach common development practices like Git and code review.
            </p>

            <li><b>Teach an introduction to control theory for those interested</b></li>
            <p>
                This is also needed for a reliable / maximally efficient robot and includes state machines, motion profiles, filters, and feedback/feedforward controllers.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="Learning_Outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>
        <p>
            This is a list of topics we hope to teach software team members throughout their membership. These may not all be accomplished in one season. They are mainly structured in a way for which we can test competence.
        </p>
        <p>
            They include programming-specific topics such as C++, program planning and implementation, testing and debugging, version control, and robot-specific topics including control theory. Inter-team communication is important for most of these.
        </p>
