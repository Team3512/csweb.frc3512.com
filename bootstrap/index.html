      <i>Note:</i> To those installing Ubuntu on their PC for the first time,
      there is a risk of wiping your existing OS on accident. Therefore, it is
      highly recommended to back up all of your valuable data to a seperate
      location to avoid data loss.

    <h2 id="Dual-booting_Ubuntu_on_a_PC">Dual-booting Ubuntu on a PC</h2>
    <p>The first thing to do is to make space for your Ubuntu installation.
    Most of the time, the best way of achieving this is to shrink your existing
    OS partition (In this tutorial, we will be dealing with dual-booting with
    Windows. If you are a Mac user, please use the tutorial on dual-booting for
    a Mac.)</p>
    <p>Windows has its own built-in partition creator. Here is a really simple
    tutorial on dummies.com that can help you with that. The link is <a href=
    "https://www.dummies.com/computers/pcs/how-to-shrink-a-hard-drive-volume-in-windows/">
    here</a>.</p>
    <p>To begin the creation of your USB, grab an empty USB stick and download
    an Ubuntu .iso file (you have a choice between the stable and lastest
    releases. Stable versions are recommended.) at the <a href=
    "https://ubuntu.com/">official Ubuntu website</a>.</p>
    <p>Next, you need to install a "USB creator" to help create your bootable
    USB stick. Some USB creators include <a href=
    "https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/">Universal
    USB Installer (or UUI)</a> and <a href=
    "https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a>. Instructions are
    provided on both of the websites on how to use each individual creator.</p>
    <p>After doing so, you can then close the installer once it states that the
    bootable USB is ready. At this point, you can restart your PC enable to
    start the installation process.</p>
    <p>To boot off your newly-created USB, you would need to access your
    computer's BIOS. This can be access by pressing a certain key(s) when you
    first boot up. Your BIOS keys depend on your PC's manufacturer, which can
    usually be found with a quick Google search.</p>
    <p>After you have successfully accessed your BIOS, press your appropriate
    key to open up your boot options. Select your USB device that with the
    Ubuntu installer installed onto it. Once you see the Ubuntu start up
    screen, all you have to do is to follow onscreen instructions. When Ubuntu
    asks for where you would like to have the Ubuntu OS installed, click
    "Something Else". Only select this option, as the others may mess up your
    existing Windows installation. It would then ask you to select an empty
    partition for you to install on. Select the empty partition that you
    created using the Windows shrinking tool and select next. After that,
    installation is pretty straight forward.</p>
    <p>Congrats! You now have Ubuntu and Windows at the same time!</p>
    <h2 id="Dual-booting_Ubuntu_on_a_Macbook">Dual-booting Ubuntu on a
    Macbook</h2>
    <p>Dual-booting any Linux distro on a Macbook requires you to get your
    hands more dirty. For this tutorial, I'll be referencing this article by
    Chris Hoffman on HowToGeek.com on how to do this. The website is <a href=
    "https://www.howtogeek.com/187410/how-to-install-and-dual-boot-linux-on-a-mac/">
    here</a>.</p>
    <p>Before doing anything, make sure that you have full-disk encryption
    disabled. Otherwise, you may come across some weird issues when setting up
    the necessary tools to start the dual-boot process.</p>
    <p>First, you need to install rEFInd onto your Macbook, which allows you to
    boot onto many other operating systems installed onto your
    machine.</p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/">Download it
    here</a>. Select the .zip file of the latest, stable build. Open a terminal
    window, drag the install.sh file on to the window, and press enter to begin
    the installation process. It may require your password (or admin password
    if you are not the admin) to allow this action, so have that handy. Once it
    is done, restart your Mac and you should see the boot manager menu.
    <p>Next, we need to shrink the existing Mac OS space to make some space for
    Ubuntu. This can be achieved by using the Disk Utility tool preinstalled
    onto your Mac. Just open the tool and shrink your current storage amount
    for the Mac OSX. Although the minimum storage limit for Ubuntu is 5GB, it
    is recommended allow storage greater than 5GBs. Most recommend 20GB to
    30GB, but it depends on what you want. Just leave adequate amount of room
    for OSX is you plan on continuing to add data to your machine. Don't create
    a partition, just leave the empty storage alone.</p>
    <p>Create your USB creator as usual (software is compatable with Mac).
    After creation, simply restart your computer and you will approach the boot
    menu for rEFInd. Select the inserted USB stick with the Ubuntu installer
    installed to boot into the boot launcher. From there, installation is the
    same as what is descibed in the Windows tutorial. After the installation,
    your Mac will boot into the same menu at startup always. From there, you
    can change between booting into Mac and booting into Ubuntu.</p>
    <p>That is all you have to do! You can also follow the article I used (link
    at top) to do this tutorial as well.</p>

    <h2 id="The_tools">The tools</h2>
    <h3 id="Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code</h3>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment which makes
    it easier to write, build, and test programs written in C++, Python, and
    more! Once set up using one of the installation methods above, then all you
    need to know is how to use the terminal and a little bit of git to get
    started.</p>
    <p>Note: Visual Studio Code occasionally shows outdated or false errors in
    a project file. There is no workaround, so instead just use gradle/CMake to
    build your project. Keep in mind errors shown in the IDE aren't
    authoritative. The console build output should be used to determine whether
    the executable was built successfully.</p>
    <h3 id="GCC_compiler">GCC compiler</h3>
    <p>This is the compiler gradle or CMake will use to build the programs you
    write. MSYS2 provides a Linux-like environment with this compiler.</p>
    <h3>CMake</h3>
    <p>CMake will be used to build your personal projects. For better
    integration with VS Code, download the "CMake Tools" extension under VS
    Code's extensions tab.</p>
    <h3 id="Gradle">Gradle</h3>
    <p>Gradle is a build automation tool that we use to build the robot
    project. To use it, just run one of the scripts in the robot project. See
    <a href="https://github.com/frc3512/Robot-2020#build-options">here</a> for
    more.</p>
    <h3 id="Git">Git</h3>
    <p>Git is a version control system used to manage the code you write. See
    <a href="../ci/intro-to-git/index.html">Intro to Git</a> for more
    information and detailed setup.</p>
    <h3 id="GitHub">GitHub</h3>
    <p>GitHub provides web based code review and repository management for the
    Git version control system. Our GitHub organization is <a href=
    "https://github.com/frc3512/">here</a>. User setup instructions are
    <a href="../ci/github/#Setup">here</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="Formatter">Formatter</h3>
    <p>Formatters help ensure style guide conformance by automatically
    correcting deviations. We use the Python 3 scripts provided in WPILib's
    style guide repository and clang-format for source code formatting. We also
    use Python 3 for optimizing feedback control system behavior. To run the
    formatter on a project, run:</p><code>python3 -m wpiformat</code>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Note:</i> The formatter should be considered a safety net. It is good
      practice to be familiar with the enforced style guide and be able to
      write code in that style directly.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>GCC Compiler</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the MSYS2 installer from <a href=
      "https://www.msys2.org/">here</a> and run it. Use the default
      installation directory.
      </li>
      <li><code>pacman -Syu</code>, then close all terminals when directed to
      do so.</li>
      <li><code>pacman -Su</code></li>
      <li>Add MSYS2 to your system-wide PATH environment variable.
        <ul>
          <li>32-bit path: "C:\msys32\usr\bin"</li>
          <li>64-bit path: "C:\msys64\usr\bin"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Create a desktop shortcut for "MSYS2 MSYS" if desired.</li>
      <li><code>pacman -S --needed base-devel gcc</code>, then when prompted
      for which packages in the base-devel group to install, press Enter to
      select the default option (all of them).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Git</h3><code>pacman -S git</code>
    <h3>Formatter</h3>
    <p>Download the latest version of LLVM from <a href=
    "https://releases.llvm.org/download.html">here</a> under "Pre-Built
    Binaries" and run it. The default installation options are fine. Don't
    worry if you see the following; it's irrelevant to our use.</p>
    <pre>Installing MSVC integration...
Failed to find MSBuild toolsets directory.
MSVC integration install failed.</pre>
    <p>MSYS2 keeps a separate PATH environment variable from the operating
    system. Run the following command to add the LLVM installation to it.</p>
    <p><code>echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/LLVM/bin' &gt;&gt;
    ~/.bashrc</code></p>
    <p>The following commands install Python and pip, then use pip to install
    wpiformat.</p>
    <pre>
pacman -S python
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip install wpiformat</pre>
    <p>After those commands complete, close and reopen the terminal so the PATH
    environment variable change from earlier takes effect.</p>
    <h3>CMake</h3>
    <p>Download the CMake installer from <a href=
    "https://cmake.org/download/">here</a> under "Latest Release". When running
    the installer, make sure to add CMake to the PATH environment variable
    (either for all users or just one). Any existing terminals will need to be
    closed and reopened to receive the PATH update.</p>
