    In addition to the following exercises, we recommend you do <b>all the drills</b> at the end of each chapter, although it is not required. See section 0.1.2 in the textbook for the reasoning behind this and section 0.1.1 for the textbook's general approach. The review questions are good for checking comprehension, but they aren't exhaustive, so still read carefully.

  <p class="module">
    We recommend covering at least one chapter per week. There may not be enough time to lecture on all the material in depth in a given week, so individual reading is encouraged. The book is designed for this situation.

  <p class="module">
    Provide answers to any essay questions in a README file. Don't forget to read the postscript at the end of each chapter. They provide useful insights.

    Note that for files which are modified between assigned problems, there should still be a separate project for each problem. For example, chapter 4's exercises 19 through 21 will have a separate project each for <code>exercise19</code>, <code>exercise20</code>, and <code>exercise21</code>. Copy-pasting the previous project's files may make this easier.
