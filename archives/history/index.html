    <p>The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by
    transporting gears to the airship and shooting fuel (balls) into the
    boiler. We didn't build a shooter because we haven't built consistent ones
    yet and the point trade-off wasn't worth it. We decided that the two main
    ways of obtaining points were to hang the gear via GPU (Gear Picker Upper.
    Yes, we understand this name is cringey) and to climb a rope via a winch.
    In autonomous, the main goal was to hang a gear.</p>
