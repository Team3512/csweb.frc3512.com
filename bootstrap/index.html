        <h2>Eclipse CDT</h2>

        <h3>Downloads</h3>
        <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/lunar">Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</a>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Eclipse CDT is an integrated development environment which makes it easier to write, build, and test programs written in C and C++.
        </p>

        <h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            Select the appropriate platform on the page's right. Once the download is complete, extract it to a directory of your choice.
        </p>

        <h2>MSYS2 Compiler</h2>

        <h3>Downloads</h3>
        <a href="https://msys2.github.io/">https://msys2.github.io/</a>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is the compiler Eclipse CDT will use to build the programs you write.
        </p>

        <h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            Follow the instruction on the web page. Use the default installation directory. When installation is complete and everything has been upgraded with pacman, Add "C:\msys64\usr\bin" or "C:\msys32\usr\bin" to your PATH environment variable depending on whether you used the x86_64 installer or i686 installer respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            To actually install the compiler into the environment, open an MSYS2 terminal and run <code>pacman -S base-devel gcc</code>. This will install make, gcc, and other required tools.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning C++</h2>
        <p>
            Once the development environment is set up, one may begin learning C++. We use the textbook <i>Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2<sup>nd</sup> edition)</i> by Bjarne Stroustrup (ISBN: 978-0-321-99278-9). Either a copy will be provided by the software team or a copy can be bought <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/programming-principles-and-practice-using-c-plus-plus-9780321992789">directly from the publisher</a>. The current textbook errata are <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP2errata.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Useful resources for the C++ standard library include <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <p>
            Git is a version control system used to manage the code one writes. See <a href="../who/tav/git101/index.html">Git 101</a> for more information and installation instructions.
