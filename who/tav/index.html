  <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This page serves as a repository of knowledge for topics I have learned about as a student on 3512 and as a mentor the following years. In case it wasn't obvious, this website layout mimics that of a college instructor as a joke. I am obviously not one. :)
  </p>
  <p>
    The following sites will prove very useful when working through some of this material.
