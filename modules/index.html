  <p>
    This page serves as a repository of knowledge for topics the software team has explored in the past and topics alumni are learning in college. Students probably won't be able to learn everything in one year, but students are encouraged to learn outside of build sessions to become effective members as soon as possible.

        Introduces the topic of control systems and how they can improve the performance of a robot. State machines and PID controllers are presented as simple yet effective tools for most control applications in FRC. The dynamics of PID controllers, their types, and procedures for tuning them effectively are also discussed.
