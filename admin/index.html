    <h2 id="Student_organizational_structure">Student organizational
    structure</h2>
    <p>Since 3512 was founded, the software team has enjoyed a certain level of
    autonomy. With that, we've been free to establish our own internal
    leadership structure. Rather than a typical top-down leadership structure,
    we operate more like a "software committee". Everyone is equal and
    contributes to the code base on their own volition with mentors performing
    quality control. There is a software lead who handles meetings and shields
    the members from administrative stuff, but the title doesn't imply any
    superiority or power over the other members.</p>
    <p>This works best when everyone is equal in skill level, so the mentors
    work hard to promote learning among rookies to raise their level of
    competency to that of their peers. We encourage collaboration with the
    other students to aid in this process.</p>
    <h2 id="Role_of_the_mentor">Role of the mentor</h2>
    <p>Pursuant to the goals listed <a href="goals/">here</a>, the mentors
    teach rookies the basics of writing software and enough of the tools to
    make them productive contributors. The veterans already know how to write
    software, so the mentors can focus on actually teaching them software
    engineering. Ideally, the students contribute during the design process and
    are able to justify their design decisions.</p>
    <p>The students learn the subject matter most efficiently with mentor
    guidance, so the mentors are fundamentally in a partnership with the
    students. While the students should do the work, the mentors should use
    their experience to inform the students of available tools and potential
    pitfalls so an informed design decision is made. In this sense, the mentors
    are primarily in an advisory role.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, mentors should always provide an unbiased analysis.
    Transparency helps build trust, and specific solutions always have
    drawbacks. The mentor should be honest about them so the students develop a
    level-headed view of the world.</p>
    <p>However, the mentors also possess the long-term vision for the team and
    should push the boundaries of the team's accomplishments each year to
    achieve it. To do this, the mentors may implement tricky bits of framework
    code, but the students should still understand what has been written and
    should be walked through it step-by-step if necessary. Remember that FIRST
    is a mentor-based program, but it is for the <i>students</i>; giving them a
    sense of accomplishment and ownership keeps them engaged and returning each
    year.</p>

    <p>My time as a student in FRC was basically one giant R&amp;D experience
    for me. By always being on the cutting edge of 3512, I learned a <i>lot</i>
    along the way (successes and failures included). This exercise in
    independent learning made a big impact on my future, and I want to give
    students here the same opportunity.</p>
    <p>Even in college, hands-on engineering projects like FRC are rare. I'm on
    an FSAE team at UCSC. We don't receive any support from the engineering
    department (and not for lack of trying) because they are more focused on
    research. Students should make the most of their FRC experience while they
    can.</p>
    <p>I tell college students this often: "Don't let schooling interfere with
    your education.". Seek out projects that you're interested in and learn
    everything you can. It opens a lot of avenues for you later.</p>
