    <h2 id="The_Mindset_of_an_Engineer">The Mindset of an Engineer</h2>
    <p>The following maxim summarizes what we hope to teach students on the
    software team (with examples drawn from controls engineering).</p>
    <blockquote>
      Engineer based on requirements, not an ideology.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Engineering is filled with trade-offs. The tools should fit the job, and
    not every problem is a nail waiting to be struck by a hammer. Instead,
    assess the minimum requirements (min specs) for a solution to the task at
    hand and do only enough work to satisfy them; exceeding your specifications
    is a waste of time and money. If you require performance or maintainability
    above the min specs, your min specs were chosen incorrectly by
    definition.</p>
    <p>Controls engineering is pragmatic in a similar respect: <i>solve. the.
    problem</i>. For control of non-linear systems, <a href=
    "http://faculty.washington.edu/devasia/Inversion.html">plant inversion</a>
    is elegant on paper but doesn't work with an inaccurate model, yet using a
    theoretically incorrect solution like linear approximations of the
    non-linear system works well enough to be used industry-wide. There are
    more sophisticated controllers than PID, but we use PID anyway for its
    versatility and simplicity. Sometimes the inferior solutions are more
    effective or have a more desirable cost-benefit ratio than what the control
    system designer considers ideal or clean. Choose the tool that is most
    effective.</p>
    <p>Solutions need to be good enough, but do not need to be perfect. We want
    to avoid integrators as they introduce instability, but we use them anyway
    because they work well for meeting tracking specifications. One should not
    blindly defend a design or follow an ideology, because there is always a
    case where its antithesis is a better option. The engineer should be able
    to determine when this is the case, set aside their ego, and do what will
    meet the specifications of their client (e.g., system response
    characteristics, maintainability, usability). Preferring one solution over
    another for pragmatic or technical reasons is fine, but the engineer should
    not care on a personal level which sufficient solution is chosen.</p>
    <p>This is egoless engineering.</p>
    <h2 id="Why_I_Mentor">Why I Mentor</h2>
    <h3 id="Tyler_Veness">Tyler Veness</h3>
    <p>My time as a student in FRC was basically one giant R&amp;D experience
    for me. By always being on the cutting edge of 3512, I learned a <i>lot</i>
    along the way (successes and failures included). This exercise in
    independent learning made a big impact on my future and I want to give
    students here the same opportunity. I tell college students this often:
    "Don't let schooling interfere with your education.". Seek out projects
    that you're interested in and learn everything you can. It opens a lot of
    avenues for you later. With that...</p>
    <h2 id="Curriculum">Curriculum</h2>
    <p>This page serves as a repository of knowledge for topics the software
    team has explored in the past and topics alumni are learning in college.
    Students probably won't be able to learn everything in one year, but
    students are encouraged to learn outside of build sessions to become
    effective members as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The material here is not a complete guide. It is intended to complement
    lectures and discussion.</p>
    <p>Don't forget that the internet is a valuable resource for software
    development and engineering. This includes <a href=
    "https://google.com/">Google</a>, <a href=
    "https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>, Stack Overflow, and
    Wikipedia. The latter two are most easily utilized through an indexing
    search engine like Google.</p>
    <p>Certain pages from these will be linked in the module content where
    appropriate. See <a href="#Submission">this section</a> for assignment
    submission instructions.</p>

    <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>
    <p>Assignment submissions will be made via Git. To start, make an account
    on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> if you don't already have one.
    Solutions for each module's assignments and labs should be within a
    repository named like <code>cs01-assignments</code> where the part before
    the hyphen is the module name. Use <code>git clone</code> to clone the
    repository to your local machine. <code>git add</code>, <code>git
    commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> should be used to make snapshots
    of your work and push it to the remote server. Make commits to your
    repository as often as you feel is necessary. See <a href=
    "git01/#10_Most_Commonly_Used_Git_Commands">this cheat sheet</a> for an
    overview of the most commonly used Git commands.</p>
    <p>The directory structure should be set up as follows. The given names are
    examples demonstrating the desired format. Your source files may have
    different names from those shown or not exist. Folders use lowercase and
    files use camel case. Some problems or labs may require multiple files.</p>

    <p>Source code goes in the <code>src</code> directory while other files
    like licenses, makefiles, READMEs and data go outside of it. It's
    convention to define <code>main()</code> in a file called
    <code>Main.cpp</code>, but it isn't required and may not make sense for
    projects with only one file.</p>
    <p>Labs may include more specific instructions on directory structure and
    which files to submit. If there are none, submit all files used and follow
    the aformentioned format.</p>
    <p>Submissions will have our formatter run on them. After setting it up
    according to <a href="../bootstrap/#Formatter">these instructions</a>,
    place <a href=".clang-format">.clang-format</a>, <a href=
    ".styleguide">.styleguide</a>, and <a href=
    ".styleguide-license">.styleguide-license</a> in the root directory of your
    repository. You may modify <code>.styleguide-license</code> to use your
    name.</p>
    <h3 id="Option_1.3A_Eclipse_Workspaces">Option 1: Eclipse Workspaces</h3>
    <p>The directory tree above provides an example of which folders should be
    an Eclipse workspace or project within a workspace (parentheses are not
    part of the name). This ensures the Eclipse projects and their metadata are
    backed up via Git. If you do this, you'll need to include the following
    entries in a .gitignore in the root directory of your Git repository:</p>
    <pre>*.d
*.o
.metadata/
.settings/
Debug/
Release/
RemoteSystemsTempFiles/</pre>
    <p>If you need to clone your repository to a different computer to work
    projects in what was an existing chapter workspace, choose the chapter
    folder as a workspace when Eclipse starts up like usual. You can import the
    problem projects into the workspace by right-clicking on the Project

    <p>If you want to use a different IDE such as Vim, provide a Makefile in
    each problem folder to compile the executable. "workspaces" and "projects"
    aren't relevant here, but follow the directory layout. Here's an <a href=
    "Makefile">example Makefile</a> which recursively finds all the source
    files in the <code>src</code> directory and compiles Debug and Release
    versions of them. The <code>NAME</code> field should be edited before use.
    The following entries should be included in the repository's .gitignore
    file:</p>
    <pre>*.d
*.o
Debug/
Release/</pre>
