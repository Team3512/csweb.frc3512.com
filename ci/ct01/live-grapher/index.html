  <p>In this lab, we'll be using the LiveGrapher real-time graphing application
  to display various waveforms and tune the parameters of a simulated
  mechanical system.</p>
  <h2 id="Installation">Installation</h2>
  <p>On Linux, install the following package depending on your platform.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>*buntu: qt5-default</li>
    <li>Arch Linux: qt5</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a preface, if your machine has 64-bit MSYS2 installed, always install
  the 64-bit version of packages. Otherwise, install the 32-bit versions. The
  versions have "x86_64" and "i686" in their names respectively.</p>
  <p>On Windows, open an "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" terminal and install Qt 5 with
  <code>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5</code>. The download is large, so it may
  take a while to install. (We had to open a terminal different from "MSYS2
  MSYS" because Qt packages aren't provided in MSYS).</p>
  <p>Next, clone the LiveGrapher Git repository with <code>git clone
  git://github.com/Team3512/LiveGrapher</code>. Follow the instructions in
  <code>README.md</code> to build it.</p>
  <h2 id="Motion_Profile_Data">Motion Profile Data</h2>
  <p>Note: At the moment, the test server only builds on Linux. Until this is
  resolved, Windows users should skip this section.</p>
  <p>LiveGrapher uses a client-server model for data transmission. The program
  we just built is the LiveGrapher client application, so a server is needed to
  test your setup. Our test server will simulate the output of S-curve and
  trapezoidal motion profiles. Run the following commands in the parent
  directory of your LiveGrapher repository folder.</p>
  <pre>
git clone git://github.com/Team3512/LiveGrapherTest
cd LiveGrapherTest
rm -f src/LiveGrapher &amp;& ln -s ../../LiveGrapher/host/LiveGrapher src/LiveGrapher
rm -f common &amp;& ln -s ../../LiveGrapher/common common
make</pre>
  <p>After the build is complete, start the server.</p>
  <p>Edit LiveGrapher's <code>IPSettings.txt</code> to use a
  <code>robotIP</code> of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. This instructs LiveGrapher to
  look for a running server on the local machine, known as localhost. The
  defaults for the other options are fine. Read the README for documentation on
  the other options.</p>
  <p>Start the client and click the "Connect" button. A dialog box should pop
  up with two check boxes. These correspond to two different graph datasets the
  server is providing. Select at least one, then click "Ok". You should see a
  graph start to scroll by. The axes will automatically scale to fit the data
  the graph contains. To view the other dataset, click the "Connect" button and
  choose different checkboxes from the dialog.</p>
  <h2 id="DC_Brushed_Motor_Simulation">DC Brushed Motor Simulation</h2>
  <p>Our robotics team mainly uses LiveGrapher to display the state of
  mechanical subsystems of our robots in real-time so we can tune their
  response. This part will walk you through tuning the feedback controller for
  a simulated <a href=
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_DC_electric_motor">DC brushed
  motor</a>.</p>
  <p>Replace the <code>Main.cpp</code> in LiveGrapherTest with <a href=
  "DCMotor.cpp">this file</a>, rebuild the project, and rerun the server. After
  reconnecting LiveGrapher, two datasets will be available: "Reference" and
  "Velocity". Graph both of them.</p>
  <p>In robotics, we use feedback controllers to make motors track a desired
  reference signal. Your goal is to make the motor's rotational velocity track
  the reference shown on the graph. Do this by modifying the PID constants in
  <code>DCMotor.cpp</code>, rebuilding and rerunning the server, then watching
  the response in LiveGrapher. See <a href=
  "https://csweb.frc3512.com/ci/ct01/#Loop_Tuning">https://csweb.frc3512.com/ci/ct01/#Loop_Tuning</a>
  for advice on manually tuning a PID controller.</p>
  <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>
  <p>Use the folder name <code>live-grapher</code> for this project. Once you
  feel your motor is tracking the reference step inputs well, hit the "Clear
  Data" button, let a couple reference changes with the motor response show up
  on the graph, then save the graph data to a .csv file with the "Save" button.
  Include this in your assignment submission repository alongside an
  <code>src</code> folder containing all the files you used except the
  <code>Main.cpp</code> that was removed. Do not forget your
  <code>DCMotor.cpp</code> file which contains your modified PID gains.</p>
