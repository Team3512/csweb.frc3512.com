	<h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p>Output the numbers 0-999 inclusive starting with 0. Output a new line after each number.</p>

        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p>Output the numbers 1-100 inclusive starting with 1. Place a comma and a space after each number except the last. Output a new line after the last number.</p>

        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <p>Output the numbers 1-1000, but make all numbers that are a multiple of five negative. Output a new line after each number.</p>

        <h2>Question 4</h2>
        <p>Output the numbers 1-100 inclusive starting with 100 (counting down). Place a comma and a space after each number except the last. Output a new line after the last numbers.</p>

        <h2>Question 5</h2>
        <p>Prompt the user for a number and output the factorial. If the number entered is less than zero, output an error message.</p>

        <h2>Question 6</h2>
        <p>Output the classic (albeit slightly modified) drinking song:</p>
        <p>99 bottles of Pepsi on the wall, 99 bottles of Pepsi.<br>Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of Pepsi on the wall.</p>
        <p>Continue this song until there is no more sugary goodness to go around. Note that whenever your program deals with one bottle, is should use the proper plurality (e.g. 1 bottle, 0 bottles, 10 bottles).</p>

        <h2>Question 7</h2>
        <p>Constantly ask the user for a number. End the program when zero is entered.</p>

        <h2>Question 8</h2>
        <p>Provide the user a menu of options for movement: Let keys 8, 4, 2, and 6 be north, west, south, and east respectively. Whenever a user selects one of these options output You moved direction where direction is the appropriate direction. If the user enters zero, which is also a menu option, exit.</p>

        <h2>Question 9</h2>
        <p>Output a half pyramid of stars with a height determined by the user. If the user enters a number less than one, exit.  Hint: Use a nested loop.</p>

        <h2>Question 10</h2>
        <p>Write a program that prints the contents of a file to the console.  On each line, output the line number.  Ask the user to specify a file name.</p>
