    <h2 id="The_mindset_of_an_egoless_engineer">The mindset of an egoless
    engineer</h2>
    <p>The following maxim summarizes what we hope to teach students on the
    software team (with examples drawn from controls engineering).</p>
    <blockquote>
      Engineer based on requirements, not an ideology.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Engineering is filled with trade-offs. The tools should fit the job, and
    not every problem is a nail waiting to be struck by a hammer. Instead,
    assess the minimum requirements (min specs) for a solution to the task at
    hand and do only enough work to satisfy them; exceeding your specifications
    is a waste of time and money. If you require performance or maintainability
    above the min specs, your min specs were chosen incorrectly by
    definition.</p>
    <p>Controls engineering is pragmatic in a similar respect: <i>solve. the.
    problem</i>. For control of non-linear systems, <a href=
    "https://faculty.washington.edu/devasia/Inversion.html">plant inversion</a>
    is elegant on paper but doesn't work with an inaccurate model, yet using a
    theoretically incorrect solution like linear approximations of the
    non-linear system works well enough to be used industry-wide. There are
    more sophisticated controllers than PID, but we use PID anyway for its
    versatility and simplicity. Sometimes the inferior solutions are more
    effective or have a more desirable cost-benefit ratio than what the control
    system designer considers ideal or clean. Choose the tool that is most
    effective.</p>
    <p>Solutions need to be good enough, but do not need to be perfect. We want
    to avoid integrators as they introduce instability, but we use them anyway
    because they work well for meeting tracking specifications. One should not
    blindly defend a design or follow an ideology, because there is always a
    case where its antithesis is a better option. The engineer should be able
    to determine when this is the case, set aside their ego, and do what will
    meet the specifications of their client (e.g., system response
    characteristics, maintainability, usability). Preferring one solution over
    another for pragmatic or technical reasons is fine, but the engineer should
    not care on a personal level which sufficient solution is chosen.</p>
    <p>This is egoless engineering.</p>
    <h2 id="Advice_for_FRC_software_teams">Advice for FRC software teams</h2>
    <h3 id="Engineering_is_about_meeting_requirements">Engineering is about
    meeting requirements</h3>
    <p>If you can meet your requirements with a simpler, less comprehensive
    design, do it. Keep in mind that your requirements can and should include
    cleanliness, readability, and reusability.</p>
    <h3 id="Make_your_code_as_simple_as_possible">Make your code as simple as
    possible</h3>
    <p>Make your code as simple as possible while still meeting your
    functionality and cleanliness requirements. You'll thank yourself later
    when you have to debug it or reuse it.</p>
    <p>A lot can be accomplished with no feedback control and a few lines of
    WPILib. In FRC team 3512's rookie year, their 2011 robot had 100 lines of
    C++ with fully manual control except for a limit switch for automatically
    deploying the minibot. It seeded 7th out of 63 teams. Only start writing
    big, fancy abstractions when it helps attain something that couldn't be
    done easily otherwise.</p>
    <h3 id="Know_the_standard_library_and_WPILib">Know the standard library and
    WPILib</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of difficult problems in robotics and computer science,
    but most of the ones relevant to FRC were already solved by experts in
    those fields. That expertise is made available in libraries such as the
    <a href="http://cppreference.com/">C++ standard library</a> and <a href=
    "http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/cpp/">WPILib</a>. Learn
    their APIs well and use them. There's no use in reinventing the wheel
    (poorly).</p>
    <h3 id="Be_pragmatic_in_design_and_implementation">Be pragmatic in design
    and implementation</h3>
    <p>PID control isn't a silver bullet, and neither is computer vision. Don't
    decide to implement something just because it's cool. Implement what gives
    the highest return on investment first for robot performance. For example,
    if you want to spend a week on tuning an elevator PID controller, be
    prepared to show how that will improve the robot's scoring potential
    compared to manual control of the elevator height.</p>
    <h2 id="Minimum_laptop_specifications">Minimum laptop specifications</h2>
    <p>For FRC-specific C++ software development, we suggest the following
    minimum laptop specifications.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Intel i3 (i5 is preferred)</li>
      <li>4GB of RAM</li>
      <li>64GB SSD</li>
      <li>Capable of running Linux</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SSDs are preferred because hard disk drives are slow, are typically a
    performance bottleneck, and can be damaged by drops at competition.</p>
    <p>While Linux is not required, students generally have a nicer development
    experience in Linux than in Windows. A virtual machine works for this
    purpose, but it's slower and more resource-intensive than dual-booting.
    WPILib officially supports <a href=
    "https://www.ubuntu.com/download">Ubuntu</a>, but a mentor uses <a href=
    "https://www.archlinux.org/download/">Arch</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="Curriculum">Curriculum</h2>
    <p>This page serves as a repository of knowledge for topics the software
    team has explored in the past and topics alumni are learning in college.
    Students probably won't be able to learn everything in one year, but
    students are encouraged to learn outside of build sessions to become
    effective members as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The material here is not a complete guide. It is intended to complement
    lectures and discussion.</p>
    <p>Don't forget that the internet is a valuable resource for software
    development and engineering. This includes <a href=
    "https://google.com/">Google</a>, <a href=
    "https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>, Stack Overflow, and
    Wikipedia. The latter two are most easily utilized through an indexing
    search engine like Google.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Folders use lowercase and files use camel case</li>
      <li>Source code goes in the <code>src</code> directory while other files
      like licenses, makefiles, READMEs and data go outside of it</li>
      <li>For labs, submit all files used according to this format unless
      otherwise stated in the lab.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's convention to define <code>main()</code> in a file called
    <code>Main.cpp</code>, but it isn't required and may not make sense for
    projects with only one file.</p>
    <p>Submissions will have our formatter run on them. After setting it up
    according to <a href="../bootstrap/#Formatter">these instructions</a>,
    place <a href="frc02/generic/.clang-format">.clang-format</a>, <a href=
    ".styleguide">.styleguide</a>, and <a href=
    ".styleguide-license">.styleguide-license</a> in the root directory of your
    repository. You may modify <code>.styleguide-license</code> to use your
    name.</p>
    <h3 id="Option_1.3A_Eclipse_workspaces">Option 1: Eclipse workspaces</h3>
    <p>The directory tree above provides an example of which folders should be
    an Eclipse workspace or project within a workspace (parentheses are not
    part of the name). This ensures the Eclipse projects and their metadata are
    backed up via Git. If you do this, you'll need to include the following
    entries in a .gitignore in the root directory of your Git repository:</p>
    <pre>*.d
*.o
.metadata/
.settings/
Debug/
Release/
RemoteSystemsTempFiles/</pre>
    <p>If you need to clone your repository to a different computer to work
    projects in what was an existing chapter workspace, choose the chapter
    folder as a workspace when Eclipse starts up like usual. You can import the
    problem projects into the workspace by right-clicking on the Project
    Explorer and selecting <code>Import...</code>. In the resulting dialog,
    choose <code>General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="Option_2.3A_Alternate_editor">Option 2: Alternate editor</h3>
    <p>If you want to use a different IDE such as Vim, provide a Makefile in
    each problem folder to compile the executable. "workspaces" and "projects"
    aren't relevant here, but follow the directory layout. Here's an <a href=
    "Makefile">example Makefile</a> which recursively finds all the source
    files in the <code>src</code> directory and compiles Debug and Release
    versions of them. The <code>NAME</code> field should be edited before use.
    The following entries should be included in the repository's .gitignore
    file:</p>
    <pre>*.d
*.o
Debug/
Release/</pre>
