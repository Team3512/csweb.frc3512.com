        <h1>Varsity Letter Requirements</h1>
        <p>
            As a preface, a student isn't required to do anything. That is, they can work on as much or as little as they want and show up when they please. With that said, one must <i>earn</i> their varsity letter. The following is a list of guidelines for students to follow. Meeting these guidelines typically signals to leadership that one has put in a varsity-level effort to learn what is being taught, and deserves recognition for it.
