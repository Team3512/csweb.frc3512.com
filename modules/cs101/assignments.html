    In addition to the following exercises, do <b>all the drills</b> at the end of each chapter. See section 0.1.2 in the textbook for the reasoning behind this and section 0.1.1 for the textbook's general approach. The review questions are good for checking comprehension, but they aren't exhaustive, so still read carefully.
  </p>
  <p class="module">
    We recommend covering at least one chapter per week. There may not be enough time to lecture on all the material in depth in a given week, so individual reading is encouraged. The book is designed for this situation.
  </p>
  <p class="module">
    Don't forget to read the postscript at the end of each chapter. They provide useful insights.

  <h2 id="Assignment_Submission">Assignment Submission</h2>
  <p class="module">
    Assignment submissions will be made via Git. To start, make an account on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> if you don't already have one, and create a new repository called <code>cs101-assignments</code>. Use <code>git clone</code> to clone the repository to your local machine. <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code> should be used to make snapshots of your work and push it to the remote server. Make commits to your repository as often as you feel is necessary. See <a href="../git101/10GitCommands.pdf">this cheat sheet</a> for an overview of the most commonly used Git commands.
  </p>
  <p class="module">
    The directory structure should be set up as follows. The given names are examples demonstrating the desired format. Your source files may have different names from those shown or not exist. Some problems will require multiple files, but problems from the earlier chapters typically do not.

  <p class="module">
    Source code goes in the <code>src</code> directory while other files like licenses, makefiles, and READMEs go outside of it. It's convention to define <code>main()</code> in a file called Main.cpp, but it isn't required and may not make sense for projects with only one file.

  <h3 id="Option_1_Eclipse_Workspaces">Option 1: Eclipse Workspaces</h3>
  <p class="module">
    The directory tree above provides an example of which folders should be an Eclipse workspace or project within a workspace (parentheses are not part of the name). This ensures the Eclipse projects and their metadata are backed up via Git. If you do this, you'll need to include the following entries in a .gitignore in the root directory of your Git repository:
  </p>
  <code>
    *.d<br>
    *.o<br>
    .metadata/<br>
    .settings/<br>
    Debug/<br>
    Release/<br>
    RemoteSystemsTempFiles/<br>
  </code>
  <p>
    If you need to clone your repository to a different computer to work projects in what was an existing chapter workspace, choose the chapter folder as a workspace when Eclipse starts up like usual. You can import the problem projects into the workspace by right-clicking on the Project Explorer and selecting "Import...". In the resulting dialog, choose "General > Existing Projects into Workspace".
  </p>

  <h3 id="Option_2_Alternate Editor">Option 2: Alternate Editor</h3>
  <p class="module">
    If you want to use a different IDE such as Vim, provide a Makefile in each problem folder to compile the executable. "workspaces" and "projects" aren't relevant here, but follow the directory layout. Here's an <a href="Makefile">example Makefile</a> which recursively finds all the source files in the <code>src</code> directory and compiles Debug and Release versions of them. The <code>NAME</code> field should be edited before use. The following entries should be included in the repository's .gitignore file:
  </p>
  <code>
    *.d<br>
    *.o<br>
    Debug/<br>
    Release/<br>
  </code>
