    <p>The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by
    shooting in a high goal or pushing into low goals volley ball size balls
    that had the density of a plush dodgeball. As well, you could score points
    on going through different obstacles and also climbing. For that year we
    decided to do everything however our shooter never fully operated. We
    primarily did the obstacles and climbed consistently. In autonomous, due to
    us recieving very little time with the robot (2 days) we were able to make
    it go forward off of a timed loop.</p>

    <p>The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by
    transporting gears to the airship and shooting fuel (balls) into the
    boiler. We didn't build a shooter because we haven't built consistent ones
    yet and the point trade-off wasn't worth it. We decided that the two main
    ways of obtaining points were to hang the gear via GPU (Gear Picker Upper.
    Yes, we understand this name is cringey) and to climb a rope via a winch.
    In autonomous, the main goal was to hang a gear.</p>

    <p>The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by
    tilting a switch and a scale into your favor. The longer you hold the
    switch and scale the more points you get. The switch is low to the ground
    and the scale is much higher to reach. As well the end game involves
    climbing and in our instance, often times with another robot on our back.
    We decided to do all of the game with a pawl system and a CPU (cube picker
    upper, these naming conventions are on point). In autonomous the main goal
    was to be able to score in all of the various positions as well as in all
    goals.</p>
