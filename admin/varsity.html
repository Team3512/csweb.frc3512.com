    <h1>Varsity Letter Requirements</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="toc"></div>
  <p>As a preface, a student isn't required to do anything. That is, they can
  work on as much or as little as they want and show up when they please. With
  that said, one must <i>earn</i> their varsity letter. The following is a list
  of guidelines for students on the software subteam to follow. Meeting these
  guidelines typically signals to leadership that one has put in a
  varsity-level effort to learn what is being taught and deserves recognition
  for it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Made a significant positive impact on the robot code base or other
    software project for the team</li>
    <li>Was involved in the design of the robot code's architecture
    (requirement gathering/synthesis, state machine design, application of
    control theory)</li>
    <li>Basic knowledge</li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Is proficient in C++</li>
        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
          <ul>
            <li>Typically requires at least a year to cover what little
            training material we have</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Can use version control effectively</li>
        <li>Exercises <a href="styleguide.html">clean coding practices</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Can work productively with the other members</li>
    <li>Can provide meaningful feedback for other members' code</li>
    <li>Maturity</li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Handles design disagreements in a professional manner (contrast
        this with yelling at each other, which has happened before on the
        software team)</li>
        <li>Considers other people's opinions, viewpoints, and advice before
        making a decision</li>
        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
          <ul>
            <li>Evaluates ideas based on their merits rather than emotional
            attachment</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Treats mentors and other team members with respect</li>
        <li>Easy to work with</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Time commitment</li>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <ul>
        <li>Software strongly encourages working outside of build sessions, but
        that is not required</li>
        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
          <ul>
            <li>Be on IRC and engage in discussion</li>
            <li>Step up and take on tasks</li>
            <li>Follow through on tasks undertaken and assigned</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep in mind not every software team member will have the opportunity to
  write a piece of production software from scratch. <a href=

  programmers are important too</a>. <a href=

  Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming</a> provide a summary of what is
  expected in collaborative work environments (not just software
  engineering).</p>
