    <h3>Game </h3>
    <p>The objective of the game of course as always is to get as many points as possible. The team decided early on to not opt for fuel (balls) because of our incompetency with shooters of previous years, and because the points were simply not there. We decided that the two main ways of obtaining points was to hang the gear via GPU (Gear Picker Upper, Yes we understand this name is cringey) and to climb a rope via winch. Autonomous the main goal was to hang a gear.</p>
