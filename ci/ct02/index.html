  <p>Read the sections on <a href=
  "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Gain">gain</a> and <a href=
  "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Block_Diagrams">block
  diagrams</a> for an introduction to what block diagrams are and how they are
  constructed.</p>
  <p><a href=
  "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Control_Systems/Feedback_Loops">This
  section</a> describes how to represent feedback loops within a control system
  diagram and defines terminology for various parts of it (e.g., plant,
  controller, reference input). Sections with "state-space" in their title may
  be skipped for now as state-space will be revisited in <a href=
  "../ct04/">Modern Control Theory</a>.</p>
  <p>3512 has a <a href=
  "https://github.com/Team3512/Robot-2017/tree/master/src/CtrlSys">control
  system framework</a> that provides a nearly one-to-one mapping between a
  control system diagram and its implementation on an FRC robot. <i>TODO:
  describe how CtrlSys works</i>.</p>
  <h2 id="Motion_profiles">Motion profiles</h2>
  <p>When the response of controllers we tune needs to be more controlled, we
  change the setpoint over time in a controlled manner using a motion profile.
  This produces a more consistent system response. <a href=
  "http://www.pmdcorp.com/news/articles/html/Mathematics_of_Motion_Control_Profiles.html">
  This article</a> talks about different types of motion profiles and what each
  of them provide. Read from the beginning until the section "Making Your
  Point-to-Point".</p>
  <p>For most of our control applications, we use trapezoidal motion profiles.
  FRC teams 254 and 971 gave a <a href=

  Championships in 2015 about motion profiles.</p>
