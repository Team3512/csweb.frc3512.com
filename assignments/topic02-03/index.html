        <h1>Topic 2 - C++ Introduction/Topic 3 - Basic I/O and Expressions</h1>

	<p>&#09;Briefly review slides 20 through 42 of the Topic 1 slideshow. Make sure you understand how to use the basic functions of Scratch as demonstrated. The most important parts to understand are boolean expressions, loops and variables. These are some of the most core elements of programming.</p>

	<h2> ¿Dónde está mi calculadora? </h2>

	<p>I've lost my calculator and I've got an important test in Calculus 2 coming up. I need you to make me a temporary calculator that I can use to study for test. It will need to do derivatives, integrals, summations, graphing and... oh yea. Maybe we can just start with the basics; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>
<p>You should create a simple command line calculator in C++.
Use a while loop to take user inputs until the user types q(uit).
Take an input of 2 floating point numbers and a character.
The character will determine the operation to be used on the numbers.
I only want the answer to have a decimal precision of two places.
Don't fail me. I'm heavily relying on this calculator and I wont hesitate
to blame you for my inability to do simple operations during the test.
